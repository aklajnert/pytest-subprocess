A plugin to fake subprocess for pytest

.. contents:: :local:

.. include-start

Usage
=====

The plugin adds the ``fake_subprocess`` fixture. It can be used it to register
subprocess results so you won't need to rely on the real processes. The plugin hooks on the
``subprocess.Popen()``, which is the base for other subprocess functions. That makes the ``subprocess.run()``,
``subprocess.call()``, ``subprocess.check_call()`` and ``subprocess.check_output()`` methods also functional.

Installation
------------

You can install ``pytest-subprocess`` via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-subprocess


Basic usage
-----------

The most important method is ``fake_process.register_subprocess()`` which allows defining the fake
processes behavior.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_git(fake_process):
        fake_process.register_subprocess(
            ["git", "branch"], stdout=["* fake_branch", "  master"]
        )

        process = subprocess.Popen(
            ["git", "branch"],
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            universal_newlines=True,
        )
        out, _ = process.communicate()

        assert process.returncode == 0
        assert out == "* fake_branch\n  master\n"

Passing input
-------------

By default, if you use ``input`` argument to the ``Popen.communicate()`` method, it won't crash, but also
won't do anything useful. By passing a function as ``stdin_callable`` argument for the
``fake_process.register_subprocess()`` method you can specify the behavior based on the input. The function
shall accept one argument, which will be the input data. If the function will return a dictionary with
``stdout`` or ``stderr`` keys, its value will be appended to according stream.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_pass_input(fake_process):
        def stdin_function(input):
            return {
                "stdout": "This input was added: {data}".format(
                    data=input.decode()
                )
            }

        fake_process.register_subprocess(
            ["command"],
            stdout=[b"Just stdout"],
            stdin_callable=stdin_function,
        )

        process = subprocess.Popen(
            ["command"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        )
        out, _ = process.communicate(input=b"sample input")

        assert out.splitlines() == [
            b"Just stdout",
            b"This input was added: sample input",
        ]

Unregistered commands
---------------------

By default, when the ``fake_process`` fixture is being used, any attempt to run subprocess that has
not been registered will raise the ``ProcessNotRegisteredError`` exception. To allow it, use
``fake_process.allow_unregistered(True)``, which will execute all unregistered processes with
real ``subprocess``, or use ``fake_process.pass_command("command")`` to allow just a single command.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_real_process(fake_process):
        with pytest.raises(pytest_subprocess.ProcessNotRegisteredError):
            # this will fail, as "ls" command is not registered
            subprocess.call("ls")

        fake_process.pass_command("ls")
        # now it should be fine
        assert subprocess.call("ls") == 0

        # allow all commands to be called by real subprocess
        fake_process.allow_unregistered(True)
        assert subprocess.call(["ls", "-l"]) == 0


Differing results
-----------------

Each ``register_subprocess()`` or ``pass_command()`` method call will register only one command
execution. You can call those methods multiple times, to change the faked output on each subprocess
run. When you call subprocess more times than registered command, the ``ProcessNotRegisteredError``
will be raised. To prevent that, call ``fake_process.keep_last_process(True)``, which will keep the
last registered process forever.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_different_output(fake_process):
        # register process with output changing each execution
        fake_process.register_subprocess("test", stdout="first execution")
        # the second execution will return non-zero exit code
        fake_process.register_subprocess(
            "test", stdout="second execution", returncode=1
        )

        assert subprocess.check_output("test") == b"first execution\n"
        second_process = subprocess.run("test", stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        assert second_process.stdout == b"second execution\n"
        assert second_process.returncode == 1

        # 3rd time shall raise an exception
        with pytest.raises(pytest_subprocess.ProcessNotRegisteredError):
            subprocess.check_call("test")

        # now, register two processes once again,
        # but the last one will be kept forever
        fake_process.register_subprocess("test", stdout="first execution")
        fake_process.register_subprocess("test", stdout="second execution")
        fake_process.keep_last_process(True)

        # now the processes can be called forever
        assert subprocess.check_output("test") == b"first execution\n"
        assert subprocess.check_output("test") == b"second execution\n"
        assert subprocess.check_output("test") == b"second execution\n"
        assert subprocess.check_output("test") == b"second execution\n"


As a context manager
--------------------

The ``fake_process`` fixture provides ``context()`` method that allows us to use it as a context manager.
It can be used to limit the scope when a certain command is allowed, e.g. to make sure that the code
doesn't want to execute it somewhere else.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_context_manager(fake_process):
        with pytest.raises(pytest_subprocess.ProcessNotRegisteredError):
            # command not registered, so will raise an exception
            subprocess.check_call("test")

        with fake_process.context() as nested_process:
            nested_process.register_subprocess("test", occurrences=3)
            # now, we can call the command 3 times without error
            assert subprocess.check_call("test") == 0
            assert subprocess.check_call("test") == 0

        # the command was called 2 times, so one occurrence left, but since the
        # context manager has been left, it is not registered anymore
        with pytest.raises(pytest_subprocess.ProcessNotRegisteredError):
            subprocess.check_call("test")
